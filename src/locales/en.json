    "description": "Founded in 1998 by Architect Nüzhet Albayrak, Tres Architecture prioritizes environmentally conscious, formal, functional and economically efficient designs. It aims for the building or design object to be timeless in form and expression. During the decision-making process, it questions whether the design meets user needs and is good enough. Such approaches also prevent designs from being overly audacious.",
